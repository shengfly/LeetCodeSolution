We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

**可能的二分图**

此题，刚开始想到的解决思路是：

遍历所有的边dislikes，如果两条边都没有染色，则随机给两个点染上不同的颜色（分到不同的组里）。

但是这个解法有个问题，有可能把后面运到互相不喜欢的人，提前随机分到不同的组里。这中解法与边的出现顺序有关。
