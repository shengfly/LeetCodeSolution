There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

**判断是不是二分图，利用染色方法**

**BFS算法**

```python

        :type graph: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        n = len(graph)

        # 每个点 都要涂色，初始为None，没有涂色
        color= [None]*n

        # 有些图不是联通图，所以要进行所有的点进行搜索
        for i in range(n):

            # 如果当前的节点有颜色，跳过
            if color[i] is not None:
                continue
            
            # 给当前的节点涂色，如果运行到这里，其实就是第一次进行涂色
            # 涂什么颜色都可以

            color[i] = 1

            # 定义一个队列
            queue = [i]

                    if color[node] is None:
                        color[node] = 1-color[curNode]
                        queue.append(node)
                    # 如果邻节点已经涂色，并且等于当前节点的颜色
                    elif color[node] == color[curNode]:

        return True
