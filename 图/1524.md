1254. Number of Closed Islands

Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

**初始想法，俩步走，先把连接边界的岛屿去掉，然后去统计连通分量的个数**

--- 参考答案后 ---

**其实一遍就可以搞定，利用dfs算法，判断每个连通分量是否接触到边界**
