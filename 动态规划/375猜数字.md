375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II

We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

I pick a number between 1 and n.
You guess a number.
If you guess the right number, you win the game.
If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.
Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.
